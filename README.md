# Relationship Overview Report

This extension creates the CiviCRM report template "Relationship Overview". It
allows a condensed, aggregated overview of your contacts' relationships. You can
define which relationships are listed; tags can be selected as well. The field
then simply lists all the values, separated by a comma.
